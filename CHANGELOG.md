# Changelog

## Version 1.0.2

- [BREAKING_CHANGE] - reorganise folders under `extra` sections
  Instead of separating by hypervisors, the primary folder structure is being built by OS as primary key. Second level folders are hypervisors. This will allow for easier maintenance and better readability.
- added `OpenSuse Leap 15.5` template
  Template is very basic and needs more work with customisation.

## Version  1.0.1

- added `Ubuntu 22.04 HWE kernel` template

## Version 1.0.0 - Initial commit
